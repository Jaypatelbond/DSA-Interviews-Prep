Thank you for contributing to DSA-Interview-Prep 🎉

We keep this repository Kotlin-only. Please follow these guidelines when submitting solutions:

1. Language and style
   - Use Kotlin for all solutions.
   - Prefer idiomatic Kotlin (data classes, null-safety, standard library functions).

2. File placement
   - Put solutions under `src/kt/<topic>/` (for example `src/kt/graph/` or `src/kt/recursion/`).
   - Name files with PascalCase matching the algorithm or problem, e.g. `BinarySearch.kt`.

3. Code quality
   - Keep functions small and focused.
   - Add brief comments where the algorithm is non-obvious.

4. Tests (optional but encouraged)
   - If you add tests, put them in a `test/` folder or add a simple `main` demonstrating usage.

5. Pull request
   - Create a small, focused PR with one problem per commit if possible.
   - Update `README.md` or `docs/` if you add a new topic folder.

Thanks — looking forward to your Kotlin solutions! 🚀
